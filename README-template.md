## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Better use of SASS files configuration, I'm using a mild reset at the moment, for these projects it appears to be fine, I wonder about cross browser support though, presently I'm only worrying about evergreen browsers which are up to date for this projects.

### Continued development

To expand knowledge of flexbox, flexbox seems simple but has some caveats, whereas, whilst grid appears to be more complicated to start with, it's easier due to the cells containing the content more. Flexbox seems to flexible at times, when you don't want it to be.
